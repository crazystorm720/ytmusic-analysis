# YouTube Music Metrics

This project analyzes and visualizes your YouTube Music listening history data using the `ytmusicapi` library and Python.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Conda package manager

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/youtube-music-metrics.git
   cd youtube-music-metrics
   ```

2. Create and activate the conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate youtube-music-metrics
   ```

3. Install the additional Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Obtain YouTube Music API credentials:

   - Go to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
   - Create a new project or select an existing project.
   - Enable the YouTube Data API v3 for your project.
   - Create an API key and secret for your project.
   - Copy the API key and secret.
   - Create a file named `auth.json` in the project's root directory.
   - Add the following content to `auth.json`, replacing the placeholders with your actual credentials:

     ```json
     {
       "youtube_api_key": "YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY",
       "youtube_api_secret": "YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_SECRET"
     }
     ```

   - Make sure to keep your `auth.json` file secure and do not share it publicly.

5. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

6. Open the `docs/notebooks/listening_history_analysis.ipynb` notebook and run the code cells to perform the analysis.

## Project Structure

- `auth.json`: Contains the YouTube Music API authentication credentials (not tracked by Git)
- `docs/`: Contains the mkdocs documentation files
  - `images/`: Directory to store visualization images
  - `index.md`: The main page of the documentation
  - `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook files
    - `listening_history_analysis.ipynb`: The main notebook for analyzing the listening history data
  - `visuals.md`: Showcases the visualizations created during the analysis
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git
- `environment.yml`: Defines the conda environment and dependencies
- `mkdocs.yml`: Configuration file for mkdocs
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python packages required for the project

## Lifecycle Commands

- Build the mkdocs site:

  ```bash
  mkdocs build
  ```

- Serve the mkdocs site locally:

  ```bash
  mkdocs serve
  ```

- Deploy the mkdocs site to GitHub Pages:

  ```bash
  mkdocs gh-deploy
  ```

## Deactivating the Environment

To deactivate the conda environment and clean up the resources:

1. Deactivate the conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda deactivate
   ```

2. Remove the conda environment (optional):

   ```bash
   conda env remove -n youtube-music-metrics
   ```

3. Close any running Jupyter Notebook instances.
