This project aims to analyze and visualize your YouTube Music listening history data using the ytmusicapi library and Python. Project Overview The main goals of this project are: Retrieve your YouTube Music listening history data using the ytmusicapi library Analyze your listening patterns over time, such as hourly, daily, or weekly trends Identify your most played songs, artists, or genres based on the listening history Visualize your listening activity using line graphs or heatmaps to showcase temporal patterns Document the findings, insights, and visualizations using mkdocs Getting Started To get started with this project, follow these steps: Clone the project repository from GitHub Create and activate the conda environment using the provided environment.yml file Obtain YouTube Music API credentials and add them to the auth.json file Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the listening_history_analysis.ipynb notebook Run the code cells in the notebook to perform the analysis Project Structure The project structure is as follows: auth.json : Contains the YouTube Music API authentication credentials (not tracked by Git) docs/ : Contains the mkdocs documentation files images/ : Directory to store visualization images index.md : The main page of the documentation (this file) visuals.md : Showcases the visualizations created during the analysis notebooks/ : Contains the Jupyter Notebook files listening_history_analysis.ipynb : The main notebook for analyzing the listening history data .gitignore : Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git environment.yml : Defines the conda environment and dependencies mkdocs.yml : Configuration file for mkdocs README.md : Provides an overview of the project requirements.txt : Lists the Python packages required for the project Visualizations Check out the Visualizations page to see the interesting insights and patterns discovered from your YouTube Music listening history data.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#youtube-music-metrics","text":"Welcome to the YouTube Music Metrics project!
